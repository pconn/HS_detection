This repository includes data and code to implement an analysis of the effectiveness of FLIR (infrared) cameras relative to human observers for detecting harbor seals during aerial surveys in the Aleutian Islands (USA).

The main analysis file is HS_analysis_doc.Rmd; the script HS_sim.R is a simulation test of the model used for analysis.  Data and documentation is provided in the /data folder.
